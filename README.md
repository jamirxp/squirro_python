# Comments
Based on the provided Task and Appendix Codes, here are my comments:
1. I only followed what is needed to be printed based on the Appendix codes
print(f" - {item['_id']} - {item['headline.main']}")
2. I notice as well that connect and getSchema function are not being used. I did not do any changes to the function since it is not part of the requirements.
3. In the getSchema function, some are incorrect like id, based on the json response from API, it is "_id". But same on #2 i did not do any changes.
4. I notice too that the batch printing is never ending. It is best to add a max batches. I did not add these, because it is not part of requirements.
